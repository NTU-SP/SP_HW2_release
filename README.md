## How to exec sample execution:
You can run TA’s battle and player with following command:  
`$ ./battle A 0`  

It will generate 8 + 14 log files in your current working directory and output a  champion message from battle A’s stdout at the end of the championship
Note that it does not mean you can get full points by successfully running with these two programs. We will check if you strictly follow the steps by checking the log files step by step.
